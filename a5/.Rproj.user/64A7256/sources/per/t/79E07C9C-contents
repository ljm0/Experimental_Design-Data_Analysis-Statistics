## Task 7

## When we apply the logarithm we normalized the data and we found colinearity between Spices and Area. And if we consider them without logarithm we do not really see any colinearity between them. By the definition of Species we get that we are counting the number of specifes in an island which follows Poissons regression model. Since Poisson uses logarithm to get the linear function so it makes more logical to apply logarithm to model log(Species) as a linear function of log(Area) than Species as a linear function of Area.

modlog=lm(log(Species)~log(Area)+log(Elevation)+log(Nearest)+log(Scruz+1)+log(Adjacent),data=galadata)
modlog1=step(modlog)
round(cooks.distance(modlog1), 2)
plot(cooks.distance(modlog1))
qqnorm(residuals(modlog1))
shapiro.test(residuals(modlog1))
plot(residuals(modlog1), fitted(modlog1))


## Since there is no data point with a Cook's distance that is close to or larger than 1, we can conclude that there is no influence point.
## We can see that the QQ-plot showed normality 
## And the residulas plot looks scatter but doesn't follow any specific structure.
